  <h1>How Does This Work?</h1>
  <p>The model that this predictor uses is called the SIR model. The model states that there are 3 main variables that are needed to <br>
    predict the outcome of a pandemic: S (susceptible/uninfected), I (infected) and R (recoveries/immune + deaths) The model says that <br>
    uninfected people become infected, and then infected either recover or die.</p>
  <h1>Why Is This Useful?</h1>
  <p>By using the SIR model, doctors, researchers, and public health officials can gauge how quickly diseases can spread. They can <br>
    then figure out the best measures to fight the disease, such as social distancing and vaccines.</p>
